        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h3> Who am I?</h3>
        <p>Hey there! My name is Lynneth. I am a full-time student at Humber College, currently completing the Computer Programming FAST program.
             Out of the different types of software development I've worked with, the two I enjoyed learning the most were web development and mobile programming.  </p>
        <h3>Interests</h3>
        <p>I like to occasionally play sports at my church, specifically soccer and volleyball. Besides reading and studying the Bible, 
            I started reading as a hobby last year and have read around five books so far, and I've been enjoying it.   </p>
        <h3>What I've done so far</h3>
        <p>What I've done so far in my programming journey is that in my past program, we did a capstone project where we had to 
            create a product and then present it in a showcase at Humber. In my group, we created a smart bin where it would open 
            and close when it sensed someone near the bin, check how full the bin is and detect if there was any liquid in the bin. 
            We then created an app that was published in the Google Play Store where it would get all the data from the sensors of 
            the bin and display it in the app on your phone. </p>
