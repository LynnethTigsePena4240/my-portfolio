        <h2> About Me</h2>
        <h3> Who am I?</h3>
        <p class="section"> Hey there! My name is Lynneth. I am a full-time student at Humber College, currently completing the Computer Programming FAST program.
             Out of the different types of software development I've worked with, the two I enjoyed learning the most were web development and mobile programming. </p>
        <h3> Interests </h3>
        <p class="section"> I like to occasionally play sports at my church, specifically soccer and volleyball. Besides reading and studying the Bible, 
            I started reading as a hobby last year and have read around five books so far, and I've been enjoying it.   </p>
        <h3>What I've done so far </h3>
        <p class="section"> What I've done so far in my programming journey is that in my past program, we did a capstone project where we had to 
            create a product and then present it in a showcase at Humber. In my group, we created a smart bin where it would open 
            and close when it sensed someone near the bin, check how full the bin is and detect if there was any liquid in the bin. 
            We then created an app that was published in the Google Play Store where it would get all the data from the sensors of 
            the bin and display it in the app on your phone. For a youth challenge at my church focused on creativity, I developed a 
            simple mobile game, which I used as my submission and published on the Google Play Store. </p>

                    an app with login and registration pages for account creation. Upon launching the app, 
                    users are greeted by a splash screen displaying our logo. They are then directed to a 
                    dashboard that offers a real-time overview of their bin, showing its fullness, whether 
                    thereâ€™s water inside, if someone is nearby, and whether the bin is open or closed.

                    Each section highlights different techniques. In the "About Me" section, I used padding for a visually appealing 
                    layout. The "Projects" section features a dynamic gallery created with Flexbox. In the "Contact" section, users 
                    must input a valid email, name, and message; missing or incorrect fields trigger an error message.

                    The game begins with a splash screen displaying our group's logo, followed by 
                    the starting page featuring our group name and a "Start" button to begin the game. In 
                    the game, players navigate through falling objects and try to survive for as long as 
                    possible. Once the player loses, they are shown their current score along with their high score.
