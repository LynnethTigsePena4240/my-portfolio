        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h3> Who am I?</h3>
        <p class="section">Hey there! My name is Lynneth. I am a full-time student at Humber College, currently completing the Computer Programming FAST program.
             Out of the different types of software development I've worked with, the two I enjoyed learning the most were web development and mobile programming.  </p>
        <h3>Interests</h3>
        <p class="section">I like to occasionally play sports at my church, specifically soccer and volleyball. Besides reading and studying the Bible, 
            I started reading as a hobby last year and have read around five books so far, and I've been enjoying it.   </p>
        <h3>What I've done so far</h3>
        <p class="section">What I've done so far in my programming journey is that in my past program, we did a capstone project where we had to 
            create a product and then present it in a showcase at Humber. In my group, we created a smart bin where it would open 
            and close when it sensed someone near the bin, check how full the bin is and detect if there was any liquid in the bin. 
            We then created an app that was published in the Google Play Store where it would get all the data from the sensors of 
            the bin and display it in the app on your phone. For a youth challenge my church had that was based on creativity I 
            created a simple mobile game that was available in the Google Play Store, as my submition. </p>

                <h3>SmartBins</h3>
                <p style="display: none;" id="text1">for the software of SmartBins my group made an app that would have 
                    a login page or a registration page to make an account in the app. in the app 
                    you are greeted with a splash screen of our logo. then you would go to your dashboard
                    and an overview of your bin like how much its full, if theres water in the bin,if a person is 
                    detected around the bin and if the bin is open or closed.

                <h3>Portfolio</h3>
                <p style="display: none;" id="text2">i made a website Portfolio where everything i learned in my web development course 
                    i applied it to make my Portfolio. as you can see my website has 3 section where i was able to
                    use different techniecs in each section. in my about me i used simple padding to arranege the text
                    to look visually pleaseing and in my project section i used flex box to add a Dynamic Project Gallery
                </p>

                <h3>WUTR</h3>
                <p style="display: none;" id="text3">for this project this was just for a creative challenge in my church
                    in the game i added a splash screen with the
                    logo for our group then it goes to the starting page where it has our group name and then a start button to start 
                    the game. in the game players navigate through falling object and survive for as long as possible
                    after the player losses they are then shown their current score and their high score.
